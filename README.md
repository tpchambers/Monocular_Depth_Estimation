## Monocular Depth Estimation Project for Neural Networks

In general, Monocular Depth Estimation is the term for a computer vision framework that predicts the depth of an image given a single RGB image as input. This type of deep learning is very computationally expensive, but it is something that we use in my lab - the autonomous systems lab. We work with UAVs that may need to use monocular depth estimators for image segmentation or obstacle avoidance in a variety of circumstances. Because my primary research is on the software engineering side of cyber-physical systems, I am exploring how these types of networks are built for the first time.
