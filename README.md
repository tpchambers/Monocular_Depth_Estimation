# Monocular_Depth_Estimation
Monocular Depth Estimation Project for Neural Networks at Notre Dame

For this project, I am researching current methods of monocular depth estimation. In general, Monocular Depth Estimation is the computer vision task that estimates or predicts the 
depth value of an image.
